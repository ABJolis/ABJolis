## Hi! I'm Anne, a full-stack developer from London.

I'm an engineer on [MoodyApp](https://github.com/BOUNCE8/MoodyApp/blob/development/README.md) and a graduate of [Codeworks](https://github.com/codeworks/). Before falling in love with software development, I was a journalist. My background in communications and conflict reporting makes me especially passionate about building robust, accessible tools help people solve problems and tell stories.

If I'm not programming, I'm probably writing, drawing, or out in nature.

## What I'm doing now:
- Collaborating with my team to deploy [MoodyApp](https://github.com/BOUNCE8/MoodyApp/blob/development/README.md), a React Native app that lets users track and analyse their emotional state.
- Working on my side project: [CurrencyCue](https://github.com/ABJolis/currency_cue#readme), a mobile app using Angular and Typescript, that alerts users to exchange-rate fluctuations.
- Honing my front-end skills by making CSS art, building chatbots, and anything else that will improve my programming and put a smile on someone's face. (See this green monster-person to your right? He consists of only a single HTML div! Check out the [Monster Friends](https://github.com/ABJolis/monsterfriends) to see how I made him!)
