## Hi! I'm Anne, a full-stack developer from London.

I'm an engineer on [MoodyApp](https://github.com/BOUNCE8/MoodyApp/blob/development/README.md) and a graduate of [Codeworks](https://github.com/codeworks/). Before falling in love with software development, I was a journalist. My background in communications and conflict reporting makes me especially passionate about building robust, accessible tools help people solve problems and tell stories.

If I'm not programming, I'm probably writing, drawing, or out in nature.

## My Languages and Tools

## What I'm doing now:
- Collaborating to deploy [MoodyApp](https://github.com/BOUNCE8/MoodyApp/blob/development/README.md), a full-stack React Native app for tracking emotional states.
- Planning the back-end for my side project [CurrencyCue](https://github.com/ABJolis/currency_cue#readme), an Angular app that alerts users to exchange-rate fluctuations.
- Honing my front-end skills by making CSS art, like my [Monster Friend](https://github.com/ABJolis/monsterfriends) here:
