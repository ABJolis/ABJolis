## Hi! I'm Anne, a full-stack developer from London.

I'm a full-stack engineer on [MoodyApp](https://github.com/BOUNCE8/MoodyApp/blob/development/README.md) and a graduate of the [Codeworks](https://github.com/codeworks/) bootcamp. Before falling in love with software development, I was a journalist focused on international relations and conflict, so I'm especially passionate about building robust, accessible tools that help people solve problems.

If I'm not programming, you can probably find me out in nature, curled up with a good book, or amusing myself .

## What I'm doing now:

- Working on my side project: [CurrencyCue](https://github.com/ABJolis/currency_cue#readme), a mobile app using Angular and Typescript, that alerts users to exchange-rate changes.
- Honing my front-end skills by making CSS art, goofy chatbots, and anything else that will improve my programming and put a smile on someone's face. (See this green monster-person to your right? He consists of only a single HTML div! Check out the [Monster Friends](https://github.com/ABJolis/monsterfriends) to see how I made him!)
